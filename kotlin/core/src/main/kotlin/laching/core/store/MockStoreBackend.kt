 * A [StoreBackend] for tests and previews: every product asked for is listed (priced by [priceOf], "€" plus the
 * id's length unless set), buying an unlockable makes it owned, buying a tip doesn't, and switches make loading,
 * buying or restoring fail. [send] plays a transaction update as if it came from the store. Never reaches a store.
 * (Kotlin ships it in `:core`, as .NET does, because apps use it in their Debug screenshot and preview modes too;
 * `laching.testing` re-exports it.)
